📌 Problem Statement:

India's rapidly growing and diverse population requires granular, real-time demographic insights for informed decision-making in public policy, urban development, healthcare planning, and infrastructure investment. This dashboard presents a comprehensive population analysis—across cities and states—based on recent multi-year trends.

Designed for:

Government Planners to understand urban-rural distribution

Policy Makers to assess growth trends and birth rates

Demographers to visualize city-wise population dynamics

NGOs & Researchers to identify areas of high migration and net population change

🎯 Objective:

To create an interactive dashboard that delivers:

Real-time demographic insights on total population, households, and birth rates

City-wise and state-wise population metrics

Migration analysis and net population change tracking

Urban vs Rural population splits to guide infrastructure planning

🛠️ Workflow:

Step 1: Loaded multi-year population datasets into Power BI Desktop

Step 2: Cleaned and structured data using Power Query Editor:

Fixed city/state name inconsistencies

Created calculated fields for average growth, migration, and household ratios

Step 3: Developed DAX measures for:

Total Population

Average Urban and Rural Population

Yearly Weighted Birth Rate by State

Net Population Change by State

Household to Population Ratios

Step 4: Built visuals including:

Line & bar charts for birth rates and population growth

Heat maps for migration by city

Column charts for household-to-population ratios

Geo visuals for regional comparisons

Step 5: Published dashboard on Power BI Service for dynamic filtering by state, year, and city.
